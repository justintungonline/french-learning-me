# Multi Search French

This [multisearch site](https://justintungonline.github.io/french-learning-me/Multisearch-French.html) searches words in French to help an English speaker build flash cards by searching:
- French Wiktionary: For word definitions and use
- Linguee: For word sounds and definitions
- Forvo: To hear pronunciations of words
- Google Images: Get images to choose to build the flash card

The site will open up 4 new tabs in the browser with search results from each of the sites for the word searched.
