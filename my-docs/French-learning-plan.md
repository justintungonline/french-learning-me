# Language Learning Plan for French

Contributor: Justin Tung

## Context

### Previous Learning

2017 and before -- school and university courses for 12 years

2018-2019: Duolingo weekly goals, French games. The good was consistent study and motivation. The bad was no study plan or strategy for learning.

## Objectives

### Life Objectives

Learning languages is connected to my vision of peace / people and communications / wisdom / understanding. It appeals to my values of being inclusive, respecting relationships with other people and cultures, and delivering high quality services at work and outside.  

### Learning Objectives

#### Tested

Complete B2 test of [European Common Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) in 2 years

#### Skills

- Reading: Understand text encountered in everyday situations (signs, practical documents, instructions)
- Listening: 80% of conversational
- Writing: Basic for messaging (text, email)
- Speaking: Up to conversational

#### Visualization

My vision of using my language skills

I am at a multisport event in Canada/French speaking area (example [Canada Summer Games 2021](https://niagara2022games.ca/)) and am helping a team member (athlete, coach) and after answering their question, chat a bit with them and share a laugh. In my pleasure time, I am using French media (jeux, actualités, vidéo) and have a friend who speaks French I am comfortable chatting with.

### Key Skills

- Short conversation with a native speaker
- Read news
- Watch a movie in target language with subtitles or play a game for 2 hours in target language
